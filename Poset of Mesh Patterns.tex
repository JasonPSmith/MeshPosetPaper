\section{Introduction}
Mesh patterns are a generalisation of permutations and have been studied extensively in recent years.
A natural definition of when one mesh patterns occurs in another mesh patterns was given in~\cite{TU17}.
Therefore, we can also generalise the classical permutation poset to a poset of mesh patterns, where 
$(\sigma,S)\le(\pi,P)$ if there is an occurrence of $(\sigma,S)$ in~$(\pi,P)$.

The poset of permutations has recieved a lot of attention in recent years, but due to its
complicated structure a full understanding of the poset has proven elusive,
see \cite{Smith14,Smith15}. The poset of mesh patterns, which we define
here, contains the poset of permutations as an induced subposet. By studying this poset we 
hope to see if the two posets posses a similar structure, so that a understanding of one 
may lead to results on the other.

There are many open questions relating to mesh patterns, for example two mesh patterns
are \emph{coincident} if their avoidance class is exactly the same. A full classification
of such coincidences has proven difficult to obtain, see \cite{}. By looking at which
mesh patterns are contained within each other, how the structure of the poset this induces,
we hope that this may lead to a better understanding of mesh patterns and their properties,
such as coincidences.

In \cref{sec:PosMP} we introduce the poset of mesh patterns and related definitions,
including a brief overview of poset topology. In \cref{sec:MF} we prove some results
on the M\"obius function of the poset of mesh patterns. In \cref{sec:purity} we give
a characterisation of the non-pure intervals of the mesh pattern poset.
In \cref{sec:topology} we give some results on the topology of the mesh pattern poset



\section{The Poset of Mesh Patterns}\label{sec:PosMP}
Mesh patterns were first introduced in \cite{Bra11} and a concept of mesh
pattern containment in another mesh pattern was introduced in \cite{TU17}. 
A mesh pattern is a generalisation of a permutation. Given a permutation
$\pi=\pi_1\pi_2\ldots\pi_n$ we can plot $\pi$ on a $n\times n$ grid,
where we place a dot at coordinates $(i,\pi_i)$, for all $1\le i\le n$.
A mesh pattern is then obtained by shading boxes of this grid, so a mesh
pattern takes the from $p=(\cl(p),\sh(p))$, where $\cl(p)$ is a permutation
and $\sh(p)$ is a set of coordinates recording the shaded boxes, which are indexed
by their south west corner. For ease of notation we sometimes denote the mesh
pattern $\cl(p)^{\sh(p)}$. For example the mesh pattern $(132,\{(0,0),(0,1),(2,2)\})$,
or equivalently $132^{(0,0),(0,1),(2,2)}$, has the form:
\begin{center}
\patt{0.5}{3}{1,3,2}[0/1,0/0,2/2][][][][][4]
\end{center}

To define when a mesh pattern occurs within another mesh pattern, first we need to
introduce two other well known definitions of occurrence. A permutation $\sigma$
occurs in a permutation $\pi$ if there is a subsequence of $\pi$ whose letters
appear in the same relative order of size as the letters of $\sigma$

Consider a mesh pattern $(\sigma,S)$ and an occurrence $\eta$ of $\sigma$ in $\pi$, in the
classical permutation pattern sense. Each box $(i,j)$ of $(\sigma,S)$ corresponds to an
area $R_{\eta}(i,j)$ in the plot of $\pi$, which is the area bounded by the points in $\pi$
which in $\eta$ correspond to the letters $\sigma_i,\sigma_{i+1},j,j+1$ of $\sigma$.
We say that $\eta$ is an occurrence of the mesh pattern $(\sigma,S)$ in the permutation~$\pi$
if there is no point in any of the areas $R_{\eta}(i,j)$ for any shaded box~$(i,j)\in S$.

Using these definitions of occurrences we can define when an occurrence of one mesh patterns
appears in another.  An example of which is given in \cref{fig:occEx}. 

\begin{defn}[\cite{TU17}]\label{defn:meshOcc}
An occurrence of a mesh pattern $(\sigma,S)$ in another mesh 
pattern $(\pi,P)$ is an occurrence~$\eta$ of~$(\sigma,S)$ in $\pi$, where for any $(i,j)\in S$
every box in $R_\eta(i,j)$ is shaded in $(\pi,P)$.
\end{defn}

The classical permutation poset $\mathcal{P}$ is defined as the poset of all permutation,
with $\sigma\le_\mathcal{P}\pi$ if and only if $\sigma$ occurs in $\pi$. Using \cref{defn:meshOcc}
we can similarly define the poset of mesh patterns $\mathcal{M}$ as the poset of all mesh patterns,
with $m\le_\mathcal{M} p$ if $m$ occurs in $p$. Note we drop the subscripts from $\le$ when it is clear
which partial order is being considered. An \emph{interval} $[\alpha,\beta]$ of a poset is defined as subposet induced by the set
$\{\kappa\,|\,\alpha\le\kappa\le\beta\}$. See \cref{fig:intEx} for an example of an interval of $\mathcal{M}$.

\end{figure}

We let $|\cl(p)|$ represent the length of $\cl(p)$
and $|\sh(p)|$ the size of $\sh(p)$, and define the \emph{length} of $p$ as $|\cl(p)|$.
We define the \emph{rank} of $p$ as $|\cl(p)|+|\sh(p)|$, that is, the number of points plus the
number of shaded boxes.



\subsection{Poset Topology}
Define:
\begin{itemize}
\item M\"obius function
\item Purity
\item Shellability
\item Quillen Fibre Lemma
\end{itemize}%

The \emph{M\"obius function} on an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ of a poset is defined by:
$\mu(a,a)=1$, for all $a$, $\mu(a,b)=0$ if $a\not\le b$, and $$\mu(a,b)=-\sum_{c\in[a,b)}\mu(a,c).$$
We refer to $\mu(a,b)$ as the M\"obius function of $[a,b]$. See \cref{fig:1-123} for an example.

In a poset we say that $\alpha$ \emph{covers} $\beta$, denoted $\alpha\gtrdot\beta$, if $\alpha>\beta$
and there is no $\kappa$ such that $\alpha>\kappa>\beta$. A \emph{chain} of length $k$ in a poset is 
a totally ordered subset $c_1<c_2<\cdots<c_{k+1}$, and the chain is maximal if $c_i\lessdot c_{i+1}$,
for all $1\le i \le k$. A poset is \emph{pure} (also known as \emph{ranked} or \emph{graded}) if all
maximal chains have the same length. The \emph{dimension} of a poset $P$, denoted $\dim P$, is the 
length of the longest maximal chain. For example, the interval in \cref{fig:intEx} is nonpure because
there is one maximal chain of length $3$ ($\pattin{1}{1}{}\lessdot\pattin{1}{1}{0/1}\lessdot
\pattin{2}{1,2}{0/2,1/2}\lessdot\pattin{3}{1,2,3}{0/3,1/3,2/3}$) and all other maximal chains have 
length $5$, so the dimension is $5$.

The \emph{interior} of an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$ is obtained by removing $\alpha$ and $\beta$, 
and is denoted $(\alpha,\beta)$. The \emph{order complex} of an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$, denoted 
$\Delta(\alpha,\beta)$ is the simplicial complex whose faces are the chains of $(\alpha,\beta)$. 
When we refer to the topology of an interval we mean the poset of the order complex of the interval. 
We briefly introduce some relevant poset topology definitions, but refer the reader to \cite{Wac07} 
for a comprehensive overview of the topic.

The \empg{reduced Euler characteristic} $\tilde{\chi}$ of a simplicial complex is topological invariant 
which counts the number "holes" in the complex. The Philip Hall Theorem implies that 
$\mu(\sigma,\pi)=\tilde{\chi}(\Delta(\sigma,\pi)$. Therefore, by studying the topology of the order 
complex of a poset we can derive results on the M\"obius function.

A poset is \emph{shellable} if we can order the maximal chains of the interior $F_1,\ldots,F_t$ 
such that the induced subposet $\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k-1}F_i\right)\cap F_k$ is pure and 
$(\dim F_k)$-dimensional, for all $k=2,\ldots,t$. Being shellable implies many nice properties 
on the topology, such as having the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres.

An interval is \emph{disconnected} if the interior can be split into two disjoint sets, called 
\emph{components}, which are pairwise incomparable, that is, $a\not\le b$ and $b\not\le a$ if 
they are in different sets. We call a component non-trivial if it contained more than one point 
and we say an interval is strongly disconnected if at least two components are nontrivial.

We can use disconnectivity as a test for shellability using the following results.

\begin{lem}
If an interval is strongly disconnected, then it is not shellable.
\begin{proof}
For any ordering of the maximal chains, the intersection of the first chain of the second non-trivial 
component with the preceding chains is the empty set, which has dimension $-1$, and as the component is 
non-trivial the chain must have dimension at least $1$. Therefore, the shellable conditions cannot be 
satisfied by any ordering.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\cite[Corollary 3.1.9]{Wac07}
Every subinterval of a shellable interval is shellable.
\end{lem}

\begin{cor}
If an interval contains a strongly disconnected interval, then it is not shellable.
\end{cor}

Finally, we present a useful result known as the Quillen fiber lemma. Two simplicial complexes are homotopy equivalent  if one can be obtained from the other by deforming the surfaces, but not breaking or creating any new ``holes", so their Euler characteristic is the same. Therefore, if two posets are homotopy equivalent their M\"obius functions are equal.
\begin{prop}\label{thm:Quil}(Quillen Fiber Lemma)
Let $\phi:P\rightarrow Q$ be an order-preserving map between posets such that for any
 $x\in Q$ the complex $\Delta(\phi^{-1}(Q_{\ge x}))$ is contractible.
  Then $P$ and $Q$ are homotopy equivalent.
\end{prop}

In the subsequent sections we give some results on the M\"obius function and topology of the poset of mesh patterns.



\section{M\"obius Function}\label{sec:MF}
In this section we present some preliminary results on the M\"obius function of the mesh pattern poset.
First we consider the case that two mesh patterns have the same underlying
permutation.
\begin{lem}
If $\cl(m)=\cl(p)$, then $[m,p]$ is isomorphic to the boolean lattice
$B_{|\sh(p)|-|\sh(m)|}$, which implies $\mu(m,p)=(-1)^{|\sh(p)|-|\sh(m)|}$ and
$[m,p]$ is shellable.
\begin{proof}
We cannot remove any points from $p$, we can only unshade boxes, and we can
unshaded any boxes from $\sh(p)\setminus\sh(s)$ in any order.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

The simplest mesh patterns are those with no points, that is, the mesh patterns
with a single box that is shaded or unshaded, which we denote
$\epsilon^\emptyset$ and $\epsilon^{(0,0)}$, respectively.
\begin{lem}
Consider a mesh pattern $p$, then:
$$\mu(\epsilon^{A},p)=\begin{cases}
1,&\mbox{ if }p=\epsilon^A \\
-1,&\mbox{ if }A=\emptyset\,\,\&\,\,\cl(p)+\sh(p)=1\\
0,&\mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
\begin{proof}
The first two cases are trivial. The
mesh pattern $\epsilon^{(0,0)}$ is not contained in any larger mesh patterns, so
the M\"obius function is always $0$. If $\rk(p)>1$, then
$(\epsilon^\emptyset,p)$ contains a unique minimal element $1^\emptyset$, so
$\mu(\epsilon^\emptyset,p)=0$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

If two mesh patterns have no shadings then we have an interval from the
classical poset.

\begin{lem}
If $\sh(s)=\sh(p)=\emptyset$, then $[s,p]$ is isomorphic to the interval
$[\cl(s),\cl(p)]$ in $\mathcal{P}$, so $\muM(s,p)=\muP(\cl(s),\cl(p))$.
\end{lem}

The M\"obius function of the classical permutation poset is known to be
unbounded \cite{Smith13}. So we get the following corollary:

\begin{cor}
The M\"obius function is unbounded on $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{cor}

We can also show that the M\"obius function is unbounded if we include shadings.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:mobUn}
Let $m$ be a mesh pattern with exactly one descent, where the descent bottom is
the letter $1$, and all boxes south west of the point $1$ are shaded, then
$$
\mu(21^{(0,0),(1,0)},m)=\begin{cases}
(-1)^{|m|}\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor,&\mbox{ if } \cl(m) \mbox{ has no adjacencies}\\
1,&\substack{ \text{ if } \cl(m) \text{ has exactly one letter before the descent} \\
\text{ in an adjacency tail and none after}}\\
0, &\mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
Moreover, $[21^{(0,0),(1,0)},m]$ is shellable.
\begin{proof}
Note that every mesh pattern in $I=[21^{(0,0),(1,0)},m]$ has exactly one descent
and everything SW of the point $1$ shaded. Define a bijection $f$ from $I$ to
the poset of words with subword order where the $i-1$'th letter of $f(p)$ is $0$
if $i$ is before the letter $1$ in $p$ and $1$ if after the letter $1$, for all
$1<i\le n$. So $21^{(0,0),(1,0)}$ maps to the word $0$. A mesh pattern in $I$ is
uniquely determined by the value of the points before the descent, because these
values must appear first followed by the letter $1$ and then the remaining
letters. Therefore, it is straightforward to see this is a bijection and to
check that it is order preserving. So $I$ is isomorphic to an interval of the
poset of words with subword order. It was shown in \cite{Bjo90} that these
intervals are shellable and the M\"obius function equals the number of normal
occurrences, where an occurrence is normal if in any run of equal elements every
non-initial letter is part of the occurrence, which implies the result.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

We can also see that the M\"obius function on $\mathcal{M}$ is not bounded by
the classical poset, that is, it is not true that $\muM(m,p)\le
\muP(\cl(m),\cl(p))$. A simple counterexample is the interval
$[1^{(0,1)},123^{(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3)}]$, this has M\"obius function $1$,
however $\muP(1,123)=0$, see \cref{fig:1-123}.

(left) in $\mathcal{M}$ and $[1,123]$ (right) in $\mathcal{P}$, 
with the M\"obius function in red.}\label{fig:1-123}
\end{figure}

If we consider intervals where the bottom mesh pattern has no shadings, then we
get the following result:
\begin{lem}\label{lem:mu0}
Consider the interval $[m,p]$ in $\mathcal{M}$. If $\sh(m)=\emptyset\not=\sh(p)$
and there is no $s\in(m,p)$ with $\cl(s)=\cl(m)$, then $\mu(m,p)=0$.
\begin{proof}
Define a map $f(x)=\cl(x)^\emptyset$, for any $x\in(m,p)$, and let $A:=f((m,p))$, then $A=(\cl(m),\cl(p)]$.
So  $A$ is contractible, because it has the
unique maximal element $\cl(p)^\emptyset$. Moreover, for any $y\in A$ $f^{-1}(A_{\ge y})$
equals $[y,p)$ which is contractible. Therefore, $(m,p)$ is homotopically equivalent
to $A$ using the Quillen Fiber Lemma, which implies $\mu(m,p)=0$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

We can combine Lemma~\ref{lem:mu0} with the following result to see that the
M\"obius function is almost always zero on the interval $[1^\emptyset,p]$.

\begin{lem}
As $n$ tends to infinity the proportion of permutations of length $n$ that contain one of
$\{1^{(0,0)},1^{(1,0)},1^{(0,1)},1^{(1,1)}\}$ approaches $0$.
\begin{proof}
Let $P(n,i)$ be the probability that the letter $i$ is an occurrence of
$1^{(0,0)}$ in a length $n$ mesh pattern. And let $P(n)$ be the probability
that a length $n$ mesh pattern contains $1^{(0,0)}$.

The probability that $i$ is an occurrence of $1^{(0,0)}$ is given by selecting
the location $k$ of $i$, each has probability $\frac{1}{n}$, and then we require
that all boxes south west of $i$ are filled, of which there are $2^{ik}$. Note
that this over estimates the probability, because it is possible that there is a
point south west of $i$, which would imply $i$ is not an occurrence of
$1^{(0,0)}$, however this argument still counts them. We can formulate this as:
\begin{align*}
P(n,i)&\le\sum_{k=1}^{n+1-i}\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{1}{2^i}\right)^k
=\frac{1}{n}\left(\frac{2^{-i(n+2-i)}}{2^{-i}-1}-1\right)
=\frac{1}{n2^i}\left(\frac{1-2^{-i(n+1-i)}}{1-2^{-i}}\right)
\le\frac{2}{n2^i}
\end{align*}

To compute the probability that a length $n$ permutation contains $1^{(0,0)}$ we
can sum over all letters $i$ and test if $i$ is an occurrence of $1^{(0,0)}$.
Note again this is an over estimate because if a permutation contains multiple
occurrences of $1^{(0,0)}$ it counts that permutation more than once.

$$
P(n)\le\sum_{i=1}^{n}P(n,i)\le\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{2}{n2^i}
=\frac{2}{n}\left(\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n+1}-1}{\frac{1}{2}-1}-1\right)
\le\frac{2}{n}
$$

We can repeat this calculation for the other three one shadings of $1$ so we get
that $P(n)\le \frac{8}{n}\rightarrow 0$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
\begin{cor}
As $n$ tends to infinity the proportion of mesh patterns $p$ of length n such
that $\mu(1^\emptyset,p)=0$ approaches $1$.
\end{cor}


In the classical case it is true that given a permutation $\sigma$ the
probability a permutation of length $n$ contains $\sigma$ tends to $1$ as $n$
tends to infinity, this follows from the Marcus-Tardos Theorem \cite{MT04}. By
the above result we can see the same is not true in the mesh pattern case. In
fact we conjecture the opposite is true:
\begin{conj}
Given a mesh pattern $m$, the probability that a random mesh pattern of length
$n$ contains $m$ tends to $0$ as $n$ tends to infinity.
\end{conj}




\section{Purity}\label{sec:purity}

Interestingly the mesh pattern poset is not a pure poset, that is, not every
maximal chain has the same length. First we consider the length of the maximal chain in
any interval $[1^\emptyset,m]$, that is, the rank of $[1^\emptyset,m]$.
\begin{lem}
For any mesh pattern $m$, we have $\rk(1^\emptyset,m)=|\cl(m)|+|\sh(m)|$.
\begin{proof}
We can create a chain from $m$ to $1^\emptyset$ by deshading all boxes, in any order,
and then deleting all but one point, in any order, this is a chain of length $|\cl(m)|+|\sh(m)|$.
Moreover, to create a smaller element at least one shading or point must be removed, so we cannot create a chain of length greater than $|\cl(m)|+|\sh(m)|$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

So we define the rank of a mesh pattern as $\rk(m)=|\cl(m)|+|\sh(m)|$ and we say an 
edge $m\lessdot p$ is \emph{impure} if $\rk(p)-\rk(m)>1$, this is equivalent
to the edge being between different ranked elements in any interval $[1^\emptyset,x]$, with $x\ge p$.
We begin with a classification of impure edges.

 Let $m-x$ be the mesh pattern obtained by deleting the
point $x$ and let $m\setminus x$ be the occurrence of $m-x$ in $m$ that does not
use the point $x$. We say that deleting a point $x$ \emph{merges shadings} if
there is a shaded box in $m-x$ that corresponds to more than one shaded box in
$m\setminus x$.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:impureEdge}
An edge between $m\lessdot p$ is impure if and only if all occurrences of $m$ in
$p$ use all shaded boxes of $p$ and are obtained by deleting a point that merges
shading.
\begin{proof}
First we show the backwards direction. Because $m$ is obtained by deleting a
point that merges shadings, $m$ must have one less point and at least one less
shading so $\rk(p)-\rk(m)\ge2$. So it suffices to show that there is no $z$ such
that $m<z<p$. Suppose such a $z$ exists, then if $z$ is obtained by deshading a
box in $p$ it can no longer contain $m$ because all occurrences of $m$ in $p$
use all shaded areas of $p$. If $z$ is obtained by deleting a point, then that
cannot remove shadings, only merge shadings, otherwise it wouldn't contain $m$,
and it implies $cl(m)=cl(z)$. Moreover, if $m<z$ then we can deshade some boxes
of $z$ to get $m$ which implies there is an occurrence of $m$ in $p$ that
doesn't use all the shaded boxes of $p$.

Now consider the forwards direction, so suppose $m\lessdot p$ is impure. So
$\rk(p)-\rk(m)\ge2$, which implies $m$ is obtained by deleting a single point
which merges shadings but does not delete shadings, because any other
combination of deleting points and deshading can be done in successive steps.
Furthermore, this must be true for any point that can be deleted to get $m$,
that is, for all occurrences of $m$ in $p$. Moreover, if there is an occurrence
that doesn't use all the shaded boxes of $p$, we can deshade the box it doesn't
use and get an element that lies between $m$ and $p$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:topImpure}
If there is an impure edge in $[1^\emptyset,m]$, then there is an impure edge
$a\lessdot b$ where $cl(m)=cl(b)$.
\begin{proof}
If $x\lessdot y$ is an impure edge in $[1^\emptyset,m]$, then let $b$ be a mesh
pattern obtained by adding points to $y$ so $cl(b) = cl(m)$. Pick
an occurrence of $x$ in $y$ and add the points to $x$ in the positions induced by
how they are added to $y$ and the occurrence, call this $a$. The points added
will not have any shadings in the four boxes touching it, therefore no point
touching a shading in $a$ can embed in a new point of $b$. Moreover, the set of
embeddings of $a$ in $b$ is a subset of $x$ in $y$, after adding the new points
to each. These two conditions imply that every embedding of $x$ in $y$ uses
all the shadings of $y$, this is also true for every embedding of $a$ in $b$.
Therefore, the result follows by Lemma~\ref{lem:impureEdge}.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}
Consider a mesh pattern $m$. The interval $[1^\emptyset,m]$ is non-pure if and
only if there exists a point $p$ in $m$ such that $m-p$ merges shadings and
there is no other occurrence of $m-p$ in $m$ with a subset of shadings of
$m\setminus p$.
\begin{proof}
First we show the backwards direction. Let $x$  be the mesh pattern obtained by
inserting $p$ back into $m-p$, and $\eta$ the corresponding embedding of $m-p$
in $x$. Note that it is not always true that $x=m$ because some shaded shadings
of $m$ are lost when deleting $p$. We claim that $m-p\lessdot x$ is an impure
edge. This follows by Lemma~\ref{lem:impureEdge} because $\eta$ uses all the
shaded boxes in $x$ and there is no subshading occurrence.

To see the other direction suppose there is an impure edge in $[\omega,m]$. By
Lemma~\ref{lem:topImpure} there is an impure edge $a\lessdot b$ where
$cl(b)=cl(m)$. If $m$ is impure then it must remove both a point and a shading,
so it must merge shadings by deleting some point $p$ and there is no element
between them so there can be no subshading of $b$ that contains $a$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{cor}
There is an impure edge in the interval $[m,p]$ if and only if there exists a
point $x$ in $p$ such that $p-x$ merges shadings and there is no other
occurrence of $p-x$ in $p$ with a subset of shadings of $p\setminus x$, and
$p-x\ge m$.
\end{cor}

Note that containing an impure edge in $[m,p]$ does not necessarily imply
that $[m,p]$ is non-pure. For example, if $[m,p]$ contains only one edge and
that edge is impure, then $[m,p]$ is still pure. Although it is also possible
to have a pure poset that contains impure and pure edges, see \cref{fig:pureIm}.

\section{Topology}\label{sec:topology}
The connectivity of the interval $[\cl(m),\cl(p)]$ in $\mathcal{P}$ does
not necessarily imply the same property for $[m,p]$ in $\mathcal{M}$.
For example, the interval $[123,456123]$ is disconnected in $\mathcal{P}$ but the
interval $$[a,b]=[123^{(3,0),(3,1),(3,2)},456123^{(6,0),(6,1),(6,2)}],$$ see
\cref{fig:123}, is a chain in $\mathcal{M}$, so is connected. Furthermore, the interval
$[321,521643]$ is connected in $\mathcal{P}$ but the interval 
$$[x,y]=[321^{(1, 3)},521643^{(1, 5),(1, 6), (4, 6)}],$$ see \cref{fig:321}, is disconnected in~$\mathcal{M}$.
This also implies that if $[\cl(m),\cl(p)]$ is (non-)shellable in $\mathcal{P}$
then it is not true that $[m,p]$ has the same property in $\mathcal{M}$. For example,
$[123,456123]$ is not shellable but $[a,b]$ is shellable, and
$[321,521643]$ is shellable but $[x,y]$
is not shellable.

We can define a direct sum operation on mesh patterns, where given two mesh
patterns $s$ and $t$, the top right corner of $s$ and bottom left corner
of $t$ are not shaded. The direct sum $s\oplus t$ has classical pattern
$\cl(s)\oplus\cl(t)$ and the shadings are given by placing $t$ north east of $s$
and shading any borders so they extend to the edge. We can similarly define the
skew-sum.

\begin{lem}
If $m$ is indecomposable and $(0,0),(|m|,|m|)\not\in\sh(m)$, then
$[m,m\oplus m]$ is disconnected.
\begin{proof}
There are exactly two occurrences of $m$ in $m\oplus m$, the first $|m|$ letters
$\eta_1$ or the last $|m|$ letters $\eta_2$. If you delete a point or deshade
any box that is not in $\eta_1$ then that point or box must be part of $\eta_2$,
so the resulting mesh pattern only contains one occurrence of $m$ which
corresponds to $\eta_1$ so then you can only delete points or shadings that are
not part of $\eta_1$ so must be part of $\eta_2$. A similar argument applies if
you initial delete a point or shading not part of $\eta_2$. Therefore, any two
points/shading removals must both be part of $\eta_1$ or $\eta_2$, thus the
poset can be split into components where on one side we remove elements not in
$\eta_1$ and the other elements not in $\eta_2$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
\begin{cor}
If $m$ is skew-indecomposable and $(|m|,0),(0,|m|)\not\in\sh(m)$, then
$[m,m\ominus m]$ is disconnected.
\end{cor}

An analogous result is used in the classical case in \cite{McSt13} to show that
almost all intervals of the classical permutation poset are not shellable. The
proof of this follows from the Marcus-Tardos theorem, we have seen this result
does not apply in the mesh pattern case so we cannot prove a similar result
using this technique.  A similar problem was studied for boxed mesh patterns in
permutations in \cite{AKV13}, which is equivalent to boxed mesh patterns in
fully shaded mesh patterns. So we leave it as an open question:

\begin{que}
What proportion of intervals of $\mathcal{M}$ are shellable?
\end{que}

\section{Open Questions}

\begin{conj}
Every interval of $\mathcal{M}$ is unimodal.
