	Dear Reviewer,

\vskip 20pt

Our apologies for the delay in submitting the revision. We have addressed
the issues you raised and outlined the changed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item The issue in the third paragraph of the proof of Lemma 4.3 was a problem with the proof
(and the main reason for the delay in the revision). To fix this problem we introduced 
a new lemma before Lemma 4.3 which addresses this. We also rewrote the proof of Lemma 4.3 (now 4.4)
which address the second problem raised about the proof.
\item Proposition 4.4 (now 4.5) should indeed read proper subset. We have changed this and
altered the first paragraph of the proof to address this.
\item We added a comment on page 5 that $c_1$ and $c_{k_1}$ should be minimal and maximal elements.
\item On page 11 we expanded on the comment about deleting elements and merging boxes, and we
introduced some terminology used in the new proofs of Lemma 4.4 and 4.5
\item Added a comment to proof of Lemma 5.4 that $P_1\cup Q_1$ and $P_2\cup Q_2$ are connected.
\end{itemize}

Many Thanks,

Jason Smith and Henning Ulfarsson
