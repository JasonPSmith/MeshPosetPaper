	Dear Reviewer,

\vskip 20pt

We have reworked the proof of Lemma 4.4, and as a consequence the old Lemma 4.3 became unnecessary, so we have removed it. Hence the old Lemma 4.4 is now Lemma 4.3. In the proof we have corrected what was paragraph 3, using a new argument which fixes the error outlined in your last review.

We thank you for your patience with this proof and apologise for the time it has taken to fix this mistake. 

We have also corrected the three small mistakes.

Many Thanks,

Jason Smith and Henning Ulfarsson
