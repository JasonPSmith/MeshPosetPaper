Dear Reviewer,

Our apologies for the delay in submitting the revision. We have addressed
the issues you raised and outlined the changed below.

The issue in the third paragraph of the proof of Lemma 4.3 was a problem with the proof
(and the main reason for the delay in the revision). To fix this problem we introduced 
a new lemma before Lemma 4.3 which addresses this. We also rewrote the proof of Lemma 4.3 (now 4.4)
which address the second problem raised about the proof.

Proposition 4.4 (now 4.5) should indeed read proper subset. We have changed this and
altered the first paragraph of the proof to address this.

We added a comment on page 5 that c_1 and c_{k_1} should be minimal and maximal elements.

On page 11 we expanded on the comment about deleting elements and merging boxes, and we
introduced some terminology used in the new proofs of Lemma 4.4 and 4.5

Added a comment to proof of Lemma 5.4 that P_1\cup Q_1 and P_2\cup Q_2 are connected.


Best,
Jason Smith and Henning Ulfarsson
