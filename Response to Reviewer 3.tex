	Dear Reviewer,

We have addressed the issues you raised and outlined the changes below.

\begin{itemize}
\item We have reworded the first paragraph of the proof of Lemma 4.3, making the conditions of the claim more explicit. 
\item We have made changes to the proof of Lemma 4.4, by adding more detailed explanations of the issues raised.
\end{itemize}

Many Thanks,

Jason Smith and Henning Ulfarsson
