Dear Reviewer,

We have corrected the mistakes you pointed out, and outlined the changes below.

We replaced dimension with height throughout the paper. The length of a chain is defined in Section 2.1, and we added an extra line to clarify that it is one less than the number of elements.

The fact that disconnectivity inhibits shellability is well known but we are unable to find a source where it is explicitly stated. However, we have added a reference to MS15 where it is mentioned for the pure case.

We clarified what we mean by the Mobius function being unbounded, and changed the reference to Sagan and Vatter.

There was an error in the proof of Lemma 4.3. So it has been completely rewritten with a new argument.

We corrected the typographical errors.

Best,
Jason Smith and Henning Ulfarsson
